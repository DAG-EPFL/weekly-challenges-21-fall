    "## The task\n",
    "\n",
    "You wake up in a parallel universe in which the Lac Léman has been replaced by a large stream. You want to take this opportunity to walk to Évian-les-Bains and relax. However, according to the locals, it's not safe to cross the stream at the moment because it's full of garbage. You look down at the stream; rather than water, you discover that it's a stream of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "You sit for a while and record part of the stream (your puzzle input). The characters represent groups—sequences that begin with `{` and end with `}`. Within a group, there are zero or more other things, separated by commas: either another group or garbage. Since groups can contain other groups, a `}` only closes the most-recently-opened unclosed group—that is, they are nestable. Your puzzle input represents a single, large group which itself contains many smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, instead of a group, you will find garbage. Garbage begins with `<` and ends with `>`. Between those angle brackets, almost any character can appear, including `{` and `}`. Within garbage, `<` has no special meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a futile attempt to clean up the garbage, some program has canceled some of the characters within it using `!`: inside garbage, any character that comes after `!` should be ignored, including `<`, `>`, and even another `!`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't see any characters that deviate from these rules. Outside garbage, you only find well-formed groups, and garbage always terminates according to the rules above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some self-contained pieces of garbage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `<>`, empty garbage.\n",
    "- `<random characters>`, garbage containing random characters.\n",
    "- `<<<<>`, because the extra `<` are ignored.\n",
    "- `<{!>}>`, because the first `>` is canceled.\n",
    "- `<!!>`, because the second `!` is canceled, allowing the `>` to terminate the garbage.\n",
    "- `<!!!>>`, because the second `!` and the first `>` are canceled.\n",
    "- `<{o\"i!a,<{i<a>`, which ends at the first `>`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Here are some examples of whole streams and the number of groups they contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{}`, 1 group.\n",
    "- `{{{}}}`, 3 groups.\n",
    "- `{{},{}}`, also 3 groups.\n",
    "- `{{{},{},{{}}}}`, 6 groups.\n",
    "- `{<{},{},{{}}>}`, 1 group (which itself contains garbage).\n",
    "- `{<a>,<a>,<a>,<a>}`, 1 group.\n",
    "- `{{<a>},{<a>},{<a>},{<a>}}`, 5 groups.\n",
    "- `{{<!>},{<!>},{<!>},{<a>}}`, 2 groups (since all but the last `>` are canceled).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to write a function that, given a stream, returns the total score for all groups in your input. Each group is assigned a score which is one more than the score of the group that immediately contains it. (The outermost group gets a score of 1.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{}`, score of 1.\n",
    "- `{{{}}}`, score of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n",
    "- `{{},{}}`, score of 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n",
